                <div class="disc">
                    I am a software engineer, husband, gamer, and loyal friend. I believe games make the world a better place by connecting people, telling stories, and teaching important skills. I love the collaboration in game development and believe the best nights are those spent playing board games and video games with loved ones. I enjoy making things happen and living an active and productive lifestyle.

                <h3> BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE </h3>
                <h4> Emphasis in Engineering and Entertainment Arts </h4>
                <p> I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Utah with an emphasis in Engineering and Entertainment Arts. The U's E.A.E., or video game design, program has been awarded the #1 video game program in the country by the Princeton Review three of the last five years. We learn the fundamentals of game design, the history of video games, how to work with artists, producers, and other team members. We learn everything computer science majors learn and more. </p>

                <h3> TEACHER'S ASSISTANT</h3>
                <h4> University of Utah</h4>
                <p> As a teacher's assistant I helped teach weekly labs on programming concepts such as software testing, source control, visual studio, etc. I was also heavily involved in grading students assignments and making judgements on their code quality. I also mentored and tutored students for multiple hours every week.</p>

                <h3> GAMECRAFT CLUB MEMBER AND TREASURER </h3>
                <h4> University of Utah Game Development Club</h3>
                <p> At GameCraft we meet weekly to discuss making games. We have guest speakers from the industry speak to us and faculty members teach us about making games. We have monthly game jams and have built a community of developers and artists at the University of Utah. When I joined, the club was dying and had a bad rep with only 4-5 members. Now we are a thriving community with a Discord server of 100+ people, 30+ average attendance at meetings, and are respected by the school and staff.</p>
