                <p> I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Utah with an emphasis in Engineering and Entertainment Arts. The U's E.A.E., or video game design, program has been awarded the #1 video game program in the country by the Princeton Review. We learn the fundamentals of game design, the history of video games, how to work with artists, producers, and other team members. We learn everything computer science majors learn and more. </p>

                <h3> TEACHER'S ASSISTANT FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASSES - UNIVERSITY OF UTAH </h3>
                <p> As a teacher's assistant I helped teach weekly labs on programming concepts such as software testing, source control, visual studio, etc. I was also heavily involved in grading students assignments and making judgements on their code quality. I also mentored and tutored students for multiple hours every week.</p>
